   hey ya, i have a question. i need to use blueprint to control some actors depend on a work flow. some of the actors need to move or do some operation sequentially, and others need to do the same tings in parallel. how can i implement such feature? do i need multithreading?

   Actors doing something is going to add up to the Game thread frametime. Unreal will finish all the stuff that supposed to happen in that particular frame before moving on to the next. (已编辑)

   Totally understandable! There's so many different things that go into games it's completely unreasonable to expect any one person to know it all. I only know my own little bit of stuff and definitely have to rely on others for a lot of different tasks  I think my most frequent reply in cpp when people ask me a question is some variation of "That's not an area I know about, sorry"

   I think if anyting, MTing would just even out the tasks, possibly reducing the frame time. Though I don't think BPs are capable of MTing to begin with

   > Though I don't think BPs are capable of MTing to begin with

   They are not and in fact it is not safe to interact with any Unreal Object outside of the main thread. You can still do multiple things on the same frame which will appear to a user like they happened at once but really they'd be calculated sequentially. Considering a user only sees updates when a frame changes, doing multiple things on the same frame will have the appearance of it happening in parallel

   thank you first, i think i understand you. probably i need to use cpp. what i'm doing now is creating a work flow, just like a production line in a factory. i need to control actors to finish some operations in sequence or in parallel.

   If the frametime impact on Game thread is not that high, you could get away with single threaded BP, no MTing necessary.

   

   

   

10. *[*16:22*]*

    Though that being said, if your BP logic does impact the Game thread that bad, just try translating the function in C++ so that it runs on C++ speed, and still no MTing involved. (已编辑)

    ## Eezeh *—* 今天16:23

    Was about to say the same

    

    

    

12. *[*16:23*]*

    C++ isn’t as daunting as people say it is

    

    

    

13. *[*16:23*]*

    Especially if you’re just translating from BP

    

    

    

14. *[*16:25*]*

    Rule 1: don’t optimize

    

    

    

15. ![img](https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/181418411044241408/5a1bf66e7c39aad689509815a515de9d.webp?size=20)@Eezeh

    ## 菊地真P | TheHoodieGuy *—* 今天16:25

    Yeah, considering a lot of built in BP functions are callable in C++ through Kismet function libs (just that you'd prepare for lengthy function names), and stuff like asset loading (which is PITA to do in C++) can still be outsourced to BP for the ease of use without taking much BP overhead.

    ## Eezeh *—* 今天16:26

    Yeah exactly if you just expose some data to BP but your logic is in C++ you will still benefit the performance

    

    

    

17. *[*16:27*]*

    But regardless you should always follow rule 1 of optimisation

    

    

    

18. *[*16:27*]*

    Don’t optimize.

    It really depends what you’re trying to do

    

    

    

21. *[*16:28*]*

    In many scenarios your framerate will be depending on GPU not CPU

    i tried it thinking it would be *better* seeing that the preference on performance is cpp

    ## 菊地真P | TheHoodieGuy *—* 今天16:28

    The difference is pretty tangible IMO, but because it's basically machine trying to reverse engineer BP without love, it's not as optimised as manual translation. (已编辑)

    i kinda figured as much, it also did not work on some bps (i think because they used structs?) Maybe one day ill optimize things in cpp
